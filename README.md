### Description
Chariot is an interactive itinerary generator that leverages the power of existing mapping utilities to generate an itinerary for its user, facilitating an efficient, convenient, and almost entirely hands-off approach to its users.   
    
Chariot allows its user to generate a detailed itinerary given the userâ€™s location, preference, and amount of time available. This itinerary will lead the user on a path to see relevant events, landmarks, and other establishments of interest within the given parameters.
