### Description
Chariot is an interactive itinerary generator that leverages the power of existing mapping utilities to generate an itinerary for its user, facilitating an efficient, convenient, and almost entirely hands-off approach to its users.   
    
Chariot allows its user to generate a detailed itinerary given the userâ€™s location, preference, and amount of time available. This itinerary will lead the user on a path to see relevant events, landmarks, and other establishments of interest within the given parameters. 

### Setup
**NOTE:** Python3 is required to use Chariot.
1. Clone Chariot onto your machine from this repository using `$ git clone https://github.com/JosephYusufov/Chariot.git`
2. Change into the `Chariot` directory  
3. Procure MapQuest API key [here](https://developer.mapquest.com/), and paste the key into `keys/mapquest.txt`
4. Create a virtual environment using `$ python3 -m venv Chariot`
5. Activate the virtual environment:
    - If using **bash**, run `$ . Chariot/bin/activate`.
    - If using **zsh**, run `$ source Chariot/bin/activate`.
6. Install necessary packages into the virtual environment using `$ pip3 install -r ./doc/requirements.txt`. (This may take a couple of minutes)
7. Flush any existing database files with `$ rm *.db`
8. Start the Flask app using `$ python3 app.py`
9. Navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000` in a browser's URL window, and use Chariot!
